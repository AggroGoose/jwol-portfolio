		I'm a problem solving professional with experience across many sectors from project management
		to people leading. I'm known for my ability to propose creative solutions and critical thinking.
		A DIY enthusiast, I picked up web development in order to build my own blog.

	<p class="text-lg">
		Finding a passion for development, I began taking multiple tutorials and building various
		projects to experiment. I found joy in building stuff and decided I wanted to make a career
		change to build these skills even further while combining them with my proven track record of
		team building and driving solution focused initiatives.
