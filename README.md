# About Project
This portfolio project I made with SvelteKit which is a little overkill for its current state but will allow me to build and expand the content of my portfolio as it grows. First step was to build a simple landing page to facilitate displaying my projects, but future iterations will include more features. Planned features include:
- More animations and interactions with on screen objects
- Mobile Friendly Project Carousel
- Expandable project details (Pop over with more detailed information about the project)
- Functional contact card using Svelte form actions functionality

Items will be added to the list as thought up, but action items will be worked on only after more quality portfolio projects have been built.
